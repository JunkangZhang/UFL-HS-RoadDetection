### Introduction

This code has been tested using Matlab 2015b in Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit. It should also work on other platforms, since it's pure Matlab code. 

### Usage

For example, to get the result on After-Rain dataset 

0. Download the dataset from [http://www.josemalvarez.net/](http://www.josemalvarez.net/) and extract it to someplace. 

1. Open `main.m`, change the *route* variable (in line 7) to the location of your dataset (where the extracted `After-Rain` folder lies). 

2. (Optional) If you are using a multi-core cpu and having sufficient memory, you can use *parfor* (in line 60) to speed up the testing process. 
 
3. Run `main.m`. The P, R, F values will be printed in the command window. The detection results are stored in the *predCell* variable.
